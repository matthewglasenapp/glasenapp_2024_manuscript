1) genotype.py combines single sample vcf files and performs joint genotyping.

2) filter_genotypes_hmm.py hard-filters the genotype files generated by genotype_variants_including_invariant_sites.py. 

3) scaffolds.py creates multiple sequence alignments for each scaffold from the hard-filtered vcf file. 

4) create_matrices.py reformats the nexus matrices created by scaffolds_invariant_sites.py for use with PhyloNet-HMM. 

5) find_gaps.py searches for gaps of a specified size between adjacent variant sites in the multiple sequence alignments created in scaffolds.py and create_matrices.py. 

6) get_mean_distance_between_sites.py computes the mean distance between sites in the nexus matrics used as input to PhyloNet-HMM. 

7) scaffolds.txt is tab delimited text file containing each of the 21 largest S. purpuratus scaffolds and their length in base pairs.
