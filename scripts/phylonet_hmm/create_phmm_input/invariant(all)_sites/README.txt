1) genotype_variants_including_invariant_sites.py combines single sample vcf files and performs joint genotyping, retaining invariant sites. 

2) filter_genotypes_invariant.py hard-filters the genotype files generated by genotype_variants_including_invariant_sites.py. 

3) scaffolds_invariant_sites.py creates multiple sequence alignments for each scaffold from the hard-filtered vcf file. 

4) create_matrices_invariant_sites.py reformats the nexus matrices created by scaffolds_invariant_sites.py for use with PhyloNet-HMM.
