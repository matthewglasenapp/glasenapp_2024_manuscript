1) build_trees_10kb_tracts.py is a script for building gene trees for 10kb introgression tracts.

2) investigate_tracts_notes.txt includes some information on edge case handling in the investigate_tracts.py script. 

3) investigate_tracts_species_tree.py generates data for species tree tracts. 

4) investigate_tracts.py generates data for introgression tracts.

5) update_bsites_intersect.py and update_psg_intersect.py updates the output of investigate_tracts.py to create new files that detail the positively selected genes that overlapped introgression tracts.
