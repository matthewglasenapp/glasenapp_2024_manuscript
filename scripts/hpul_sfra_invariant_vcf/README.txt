The scripts in this directory generate a hard-filtered vcf file including invariant sties for downstream estimation of dXY for introgression and species tree tracts. 

1) filter.py hard-filters the vcf file generated by genotype.py

2) genotype.py combines the single sample vcf files for each species used and performs joint genotyping. 

The script for generating the single sample vcf files is located at scripts/phylonet_hmm/create_phmm_input/preprocess_sequencing_data/preprocess.py
