1) difference_distribtuion_80.csv and difference_distribution_90.csv contain the null distribution of differences between means expected if there was no difference between mean dXY of introgressed and non-introgressed regions. These distributions were created by scripts/pixy_dxy/pixy_dxy.py and are used as input for scripts/pixy_dxy/compare_means_dxy.R.

2) dxy_dist_80 and dxy_dist_90 contain the distribution of dXY values for introgression tracts and species tree tracts at the 90% and 80% posterior probability thresholds. These files were generated by scripts/pixy_dxy/pixy_dxy.py and are used as input for scripts/pixy_dxy/pixy_dxy.R
