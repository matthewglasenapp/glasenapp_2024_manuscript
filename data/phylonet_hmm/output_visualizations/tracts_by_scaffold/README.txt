These files contain the input for scripts/phylonet_hmm/output_visualizations/tracts_by_scaffold/visualize_introgression_tracts.R. 

1) 25kb_gaps.bed includes the 25 kb gaps between adjacent SNV genotypes in the PhyloNet-HMM matrices. 

2) 100kb_gaps.bed includes the 100 kb gaps between adjacent SNV genotypes in the PhyloNet-HMM matrices. 

3) scaffold_info.txt is a tab-delimited text file including the names, lengths, and gene density for each scaffold. 

4) scaffold_lengths.txt is a tab-delimited text file including the names and lengths of each scaffold. 

5) ten_kb_tracts_80.bed includes the 10kb introgression tracts at the 80% posterior probability threshold. 

6) ten_kb_tracts_90.bed includes the 10kb introgression tracts at the 90% posterior probability threshold.
