1) difference_distribution_80.csv and difference_distribution_90.csv contain the null distribution of differences between means expected if there was no difference between mean dN, dS, and dNdS of introgressed and non-introgressed genes. These distributions were created by scripts/paml/paml_compare_means.py and are used as input for scripts/paml/paml_compare_means.R. 

2) paml_dist_80.csv and paml_dist_90.csv are csv files containing the distribution of dN, dS, and dN/dS for both introgressed and non-introgressed genes at the 80% posterior probability threshold and 90% posterior probability threshold. These files were generated by scripts/paml/paml_compare_means.py and are used as input for scripts/paml/paml_90.R and scripts/paml/paml_80.R
